# TL;DRs

## The Old Piece

A sculptor finds an old dark piece of sculpture - a totem of the old ones who inhabited Torin before the coming of humans. She spends time trying to learn about it... only to find that it is desperately trying to _leave_ Torin. She feels sympathetic to the spirit in the totem, but does not want to leave Torin at all. The thing exerts deadly influences; she gradually finds that she can not enjoy her drunken drugged binges. Her sculptures begin to reflect the things that are coming to get the totem; she begins to fear that she's left it too late.

The story piece is one of her sculptures? Or is the contagion spilling out into the other sculptors? The figure showing up in their work?

## A Girl Who Could Really Draw

She, like most, is always drawing on a board with charcoal. She parties with them other art students, and works, and smokes a lot of hemp. The Painter is working with her, forcing her to draw, forcing her to work at it. Her drawings begin to evoke times long ago. She shows people sitting at the tables, dancing, merrymaking. She is drawing an old story, it seems, in which the words the people say can only be guessed. She takes sick, and when she recovers, the story has escaped her. 

The story piece is a beautifully done drawing of a man in the finery of bygone days, turning to look over his shoulder, with an expression of loss and hesitation so perfectly done as to haunt the viewer.

## Dark Boy

A student of metalsmithing becomes enamored of another student, a Dark Boy, who seems to have a sense of landscape.
