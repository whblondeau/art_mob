You have a curiously hard time finding the place.

It ends up being a long walk down a winding lane, mostly through woods. The sky is high and hard, with streaks and ribs of cloud very far above. The sun is a faded pearl most of the time; sometimes it burns through, like a candleflame in the arched spaces of the upper air. Your shadow seldom shows itself on the ground.

There are sometimes houses. Sometimes they are ruinous or ramshackle with nobody about. Sagging rooflines, skeletal rafters like ribcages.

Nont of them the house you seek, though.

There are sometimes fields. They show the sinuous lines of oxen-plowed furrows, or the intense close green of cropped pasture, shaven around the occasional outcrop of rock. The rocks here are gray or black. There are wide open spaces of marsh, with head-high forests of cattails and reeds and rushes.

Frogs and turtles sit on them, completely still, mysterious and strangely lovely - you had never thought too much about it, but it's amazing to realize that a silhouette isn't part of a waterlogged fallen tree, but a living animal perched there on its own business. Small birds pipe and crey. Herons and cranes wade, fly. The occasional hawk floats above, beauty and murder in one. But mostly it’s woodlands: alder trees and oaks maples and the wonderful cottonwood poplars that dominate this strange, almost-empty valley and lake country.

Always mountains beyond. In the land of Torin, you are never far from the sight of mountains. They stalk on the hem of every sky, sawtooth masses of gray rock, buttress piled on crag, 

You are glad you’re such a walker. You’ve walked a lot, and the day is not over, and you really don’t know how much further it will be. You may have taken a wrong turn somewhere. Roads, in the land of Torin, are
