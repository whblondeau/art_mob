# Autumnal Woman
<i>
The painting is about three feet tall by two wide. It's a portrait, a glorious burn of reds and oranges and warm brown. The woman is a little larger than life. She looks to be perhaps forty years of age, her tumbled auburn hair falling around her long laughing bony face. Her jaw is down, caught in the middle of a laugh it seems, or an open-mouth grin that exudes a vivacity and life. A wolf’s grin. You’ve seen a wolf laugh before. This woman has no blood on her mouth, though.

<i>
She’s dressed in clothes brown and red with sharp azure accents, rumpled, a scarf swathed around her neck; but her robe is open, and her sunbrowned flesh shows in a glowing streak down to her left breast, which falls bare and elegant. Her eyes, brown or blue or green from moment to moment, are nested in laugh lines. You realize that she’s looking slightly over your right shoulder while, it seems, pretending to converse warmly with you.

The longer you look, the more you realize that the painter captured something almost impossible to believe, something that’s looking out at you. 

The impact of the painting is solid and exhilarating. You find yourself studying the simple, perfect brushwork—you have learned to see brush strokes as individual decisions, and the mastery of those choices haunts you.

There's a world to fall into in this painting. Shadow and light, color and cloth, the intense impact of the woman's expression, the vivid personality that leaps from the canvas. In an unworthy, wayward moment, you feel a passing hope that your own tits look as good when you're that age. But your absorption and delight, your artist's eye, prevails. You're not really all that self-regarding, are you? The vain concern for the appearance of your own breasts is no more than a brief glimmer: it fades, and you study the painting, live within its frame. Under your educated gaze, the painting slowly yields its secrets. 

The Master looks at it for a long time, and sighs, before he begins to speak.

I remember her so well. I began the painting from life, but long after she’d gone I returned to it, trying to capture that one look. I was afraid that I’d forget it and never be able to finish it. I needn’t have worried; I’ll never forget it. I’m happy with this one, because that’s exactly how she looked. Exactly.

Thaseraine was my friend. She worked in clay. I think she used a fair amount of magic, especially for the glazes; but she was far too wise to get herself into trouble with that.

Yes, I was attracted to her—you only need look at the painting to see it, if you’ve got eyes, and I’m starting to think that you do—but we never were lovers, nor did we ever really think it might have been a good idea. We were good friends, and even more, we respected each other as artists. She and a young printmaker named Edroc were together. 

Everyone understood that. If you care about people at all, you learn well enough that there are some lovers that you should try to break apart if you can, and others for whom it would be a crime. Edroc was a good ten years younger, but that didn’t make any difference. Their spirits fitted together well. He was a beautiful man, and a good drinking companion, and best of all, a gifted and serious artist. I remember spending entire days with him in the studio, both of us so absorbed in what we were doing that we said not a word from morning to evening.

There’s a drawing of him over there. No, not one of mine. Jirel drew it. I’ll tell you about her later.

Carezma… now, Carezma, she was a metalsmith. A very good one. She was Old Torinese of the purest blood: slight, dark, paleskinned. The old families have faded, and many of them don’t like it. The old Hill holds are often empty and ruinous, the home of bats and weasels, or of people who speak a different tongue. Well, you know all of this, don’t you. But, even in their most downfallen state, no man can deny that the Old Torinese have greater powers of hearing and sight and working than most of the rest of us. And they know more about the Elder works than anybody else.

She looked upon Edroc with favor and pleasure, Carezma did. And when she let him know, she was most shocked and insulted that he did not immediately abandon Thass. Carezma was accustomed to getting what she wanted by crooking a finger. But not from Edroc. He treated her with courtesy and in as good part as he could manage, always seeking to bring her into our group of friends. We could all see that it was an unlikely thing. Carezma had a sullen, self-important sneer on her pretty face—you couldn’t always see it, but after you’d known her a while you could tell well enough that it was still there.

A number of us tried to bring her in and make her welcome. Some drank with her, some talked of art, and learned what they could of metalsmithing—and she had much to teach, when she was willing. Some slept with her, but had little to say about it afterwards. I myself painted her a few times, and I’ve still got the best of those canvases around… no, later, in time. The story needs to come first. 

In the end, the whole situation became too uncomfortable. Carezma’s metalwork was brilliantly accomplished in technique, but she had little true artistic sensibility. When she drank, her sneer came out. We did not know enough about the Old Torinese families, I suppose. In the end, she took up with some of her own people, although she was still always sniffing around Edroc.

Thass never took it ill, though I think she was worried a bit for Edroc’s sake. We—Thass and I—spoke a good deal in those days, for I was painting this portrait. Autumnal Woman. Afternoons, when the light was right. (That was the studio I shared with Jirel and Corzey: the place you see in the painting.) I was having a hard time with this canvas: it was like something was creeping into Thass’s face, something unsettling. 

When I turn my artist’s eye on a person, not much hides from it. And Thass was brooding, distant; I was having my own troubles with a woman, and I think I tended to mistrust the mood of the sittings. But after a time I told Thass that I was having too much trouble with the painting. It was coming along beautifully, but the face was looking feral. Violent. As if some spirit of destruction were hidden in her mind. I suspended the sittings for a while, and turned my hand to other things. I didn’t see Thass, or Edroc for that matter, for a long time, except casually out and about, to wave to in the streets.

Then it changed. Changed suddenly, or so it seemed to all of us. It was Tammo, I recall,—he was a woodcarver, a friend of Edroc’s—who gave me the news: Thass, in a wild passion of jealousy, had clawed Edroc’s face, marring it. He, in turn, had gone away—“with Carezma, if you can believe it”, he said.

It was a thing beyond sense. My first thought was for Thass—our Thaseraine, our wild and beautiful lady of the autumn skies.

I remember the rain. It came down in sheets, with pauses, as it will when the wind is in the south. It washed the cobblestones, and made dull, gleaming curtains in front of the lamps of the tavern where I found her. She was drinking alone, and did not welcome my company.

In the lamplight I studied her face, the face of my friend so familiar… and the face emerging under it. The face of a deadly dangerous ravening thing. She seemed intense, eyes glittering, harsh and moderate by turns. I worried that she might actually have fallen ill, but when I touched her hand there was no fever in her flesh. She wept a little, and seemed generous, thinking of Edroc: “I will always be grateful to him, for he left me while I am still young and beautiful,” she said earnestly, with unshed tears in her eyes.

I asked her then about the tale that she had clawed Edroc’s face, and her entire manner changed. She was like a wolf suddenly awakened: the lines of her face and body hardened, and she laughed something like that silent grin that you see in the painting. But it was a merciless thing, not friendly. For a moment I feared that she might assail me as she had done Edroc. Then she relaxed, and laughed a little in her throat. “Edroc… such a fool. He would never let Carezma go. In spite of all his protestations, he had a love for her.” Her eyes rolled up and she choked a little, horridly, like a child.

“Carezma”, I said. And suddenly I remembered the sneer, the scorn and self-regard. And I remembered how gifted Carezma had been in certain directions. “Thass,” I asked, not knowing what I was trying to understand, “did Carezma give him anything? Any piece of art she had made?”

She laughed a little. “Not he. He would never have taken anything from her… he was always too earnestly cautious. He did his best never to lead her on.” She shook her head in savage self-mockery. “When I struck out at him, that freed him to follow his heart, you see.”

This made no sense to me.

“The only piece of Carezma’s art that we ever had was a brooch that she gave me.” I looked at her, not understanding. “You know how her work was always stiff, always somewhat lifeless? Well, this wasn’t. It was grotesque, but it had life. A skull pierced by a spear coming up from below… and the butt of the spear ended in a hoof. It was good. I was trying to be companionable, and this was something I could do. Because I honestly admired the thing. Breathtaking.”

“Not like her other work,” I said. “It was good.” I took a breath. “And it called to you…”

She just looked at me. Then she gave forth a groan. The groan went up into a sort of hushed wail, then a keening scream. Everyone in the place was looking, aghast. I was watching Thass, watching the long bones of her face get longer, her teeth becoming predator’s fangs, not in my artist’s imagination but in immediate material reality. Her fingers elongated into claws, her beautiful eyes darkened to a sort of dead-brown glare. Her brown skin had a chalky undertone. I could paint her that way, right now, from memory. A woman realizing what had been done to her.

Suddenly, moving faster than I’ve ever seen a human move, she was up, hunched, claws curved, staring at me blankly. Then she was gone, the door to the inn banging open on the hiss and clatter of the rain, the dark empty street.
I never saw her again. Nor did anyone else in the city.

<p style='text-align:center'>#</p>

I had no reason to keep secrets. I told people who knew them. I made it my business to explain that Carezma had used something old, something found, a Forerunner curse piece, and given it to Thaseraine. Old Torinese are still, and always, the best for finding Forerunner artifacts, and I suppose that’s what this thing was. I warned everybody. No one ever found the brooch. I suppose Thass took it. It would have been useful to her, to help track Carezma down.

I, after the wonder and worry had died down, gradually went back to work. I left the portrait of Thaseraine alone, until a day when summer’s warmth had faded into the first edge of autumn. I was in the studio that several of us rented, and the light came through the window with just the right feel, the right angle, spilling into the space in just the right way. It reminded me of that unfinished painting.

When I pulled the cover off, I was startled. I had not understood just how well the unwanted features in Thass’s face in the painting matched the terrible transformation that had come over her in the tavern. I had been painting it before it happened.

I had been seeing the curse at work, before it was fulfilled.

I remember I looked at the light, and looked at the portrait. And then I started mixing the paints.

#

It was a dreadful time, that month or so that I wrestled with the painting. It defeated me completely at first. I struggled to hold to the memory: Thaseraine, my friend, our friend, the genius of the wheel and kiln. The beautiful, gifted artist who had turned into a ravening madwoman and vanished. As I painted, it seemed to me I had never done so well, never captured the light and shadow, color and curve and rumpled outline of cloth with quite such a power of sight and hand. It was a great step in my mastery of the art of paint.

But I was lost when it came to the face and to a lesser extent the hands. If you look at the painting, you can still see it, can’t you? The monster. The monster was the point. The monster in face, in claw. Carezma’s curse was designed to break Edroc’s devotion to Thass, and it had. 

As I painted, I felt my hand and eye being forced towards the monster. I could not stop it, except to stop painting. I did not want to finish the painting that way. And I could have, you know. I could have allowed the curse to guide my hand, could have joyfully accepted it. It would have been a great work. It would have been Art of a very high order. Nothing about turning my friend Thass into a monster for all time would have been false to my calling as a painter.

I thought about it.

I thought about it sober and drunk. I smoked hemp and thimbleweed, and I thought with my brush and my charcoals as well. Study after study, on canvas and parchment and rough paper. Some of them had nothing to do with the sad story of Thaseraine, or at least you wouldn’t think so. When my mind was frozen and locked, I thought with my hand. It was a miserable time in my life, and a great time in my life. I progressed very quickly, leaping from insight to unsuspected insight.

I thought that painting the cruel painting, the painting showing the insanity, the predator within, would be a way of telling the story. And I very nearly did that: very nearly followed my mad hand and brush. Art is a harsh discipline. I don’t know whether you have found that to be true. But you probably will, if you’re anything. Anything more than a grinning fool with a gift.

In the end, I couldn’t bring myself to paint that which my Art was howling at me to paint. I sometimes dream about it, in the still hours of the night, when clouds cover the stars and there’s a low muffled thunder from somewhere away. I find myself dreaming that I’m painting the monster, and that the eyes of the corrupted woman in the painting are following me. I’ll awake with my penis shamefully erect, and a great fearful knowledge comes over me that I’ve taken a little too much of the corruption into myself, that I’ll never be free of it. Beyond that there’s the hidden terror that I will awaken and no longer wish to be free of it. When those dreams happen, I do not paint, nor draw, for a day; I fear what may find its way onto the canvas. I busy myself with other things, until I sleep again and dream different dreams.

I chose not to make my friend into a monster for all time. And at the same time, I was utterly unwilling to lie. So I took up work again, in those high days of autumn, unsure of my course, but with some sense that my purpose was workable.

I began by painting Thaseraine as the monster after all. The paint is there, or traces of it, under many layers. I felt the curse guiding my hand, and I heeded its guidance.

I see you do not flinch. That’s good, I think.

But then I began to paint over the curse, to bring my friend Thass back and to banish the monster. It was a horrid hard time, and sometimes I found myself, exhausted and disoriented, with clawmarks on my arms, once a bite on my shoulder. I was often drunk, often drugged with one thing or another. It may have been foolish bravado, but I felt that I was more comfortable with intoxication that a mere Elder curse could ever be. 

The old Forerunner artifacts are easily found and activated by Art. You know that much, I hope. But what I learned over those grim weeks, wrestling with the painting, was that Art has power of its own. Art could fight its way clear of an Elder curse.

Over the days, I fought and forced Thaseraine—as I had known her—back into the painting. Some days were not so good, and the monster would surface again; but any art student worth a damn knows that persistence is the only thing that will bear fruit. And slowly, slowly, not without reverses, not without shivering and terror and panic and puking, I fought the curse out, put the monster down, and reclaimed Thaseraine, as she had been in the years of our friendship. Thaseraine as you see her now. She is still grinning that open-jaw grin, but it’s her own self, largely. Barely a hint of fang and claw. The eyes are smiling, although I will grant you they look a bit malicious from time to time. But it’s her.

It was some months before I heard the rest of it.

The snows in the mountains are hard in Torin, and even harder in the great mountains of the Northlands, to the east of us. It was a hellishly cold night when a small tough band of traders sat with us in a tavern before a roaring fire. They had very nearly died in the passes, having misjudged their timing against the timing of the snowstorms. But they had brought pigments, and minerals for the firing of glazes and stained glass, and we all needed that greatly. We were determined to give them such a welcome as would make them forget the danger, and perhaps try it again in another winter when we had need…

They had tales to tell, tales of the enmities of the hill lords and the rivalries of magicians. Tales of heroic traders, and wicked traders who sought to cheat them. Tales of strange doings.

It was one such tale that resolved a mystery for us, and brought me to a misery that still gnaws at some of the ends of my soul.

There was a Beast that preyed on people, the traders said, a terror of the night, that traveled slowly northeastwards. Word had gone forth that it sought someone who fled. Word had gone forth that it could take the shape of a red-haired woman.

This Beast was fast and tough and cunning, and it croaked old words to foil magicians who sought to trap it in stone circles under the moon, and it slew huntsmen and soldiers alike with its jaws and talons. It seemed to know its business, so in the end folk let it pass, and shivered, and prayed that it would not take the children out of their cradles.

It was in a small holding called Ystri that a small, delicate woman, gravely ill with mountain fever, begged for help, saying that the Beast was upon her, and she could not run much further. She was by description slender, paleskinned, dark of hair. 

Ystri was a wise choice on her part, for the Lord was young and of a very romantic turn of mind; and he had a most powerful wizard on hand, and a rough crew of soldiers. They gave shelter to the woman, and laid plans to trap and destroy the Beast.

It was by all accounts a difficult battle, lasting for days: a siege in which a prowling monster sought to claw its way through the defenses, and the hunters sought it in the forests, often to their destruction; and the wizard of Ystri wove powerful enchantments against this Beast.

But then the Beast, over the days of the siege of Ystri, seemed to lose its power and its purpose. Increasingly it fled and evaded rather than killed. The wizard said later that he had managed to trap it and converse with it. It gradually faded into the shape of a woman, as the tales had said it would; and she seemed puzzled and witless, although very beautiful.

The Lord’s Captain, a man of decision and cold heart, came upon the wizard. “She is no Beast now,” he said, “and I’ll not let her turn again back into one.”

“This is a harder matter than it seems,” said the wizard. “The curse is fading.” But the Captain killed the woman with his sword.

Matters went ill with Ystri then. The fleeing woman recovered from her illness, but the young Lord fell ill in turn, and he died. The wizard of Ystri gave up his position, because he hated the Captain’s fell deed. Of all of the folk in the tale, only the woman, fugitive no longer, suffered no lasting harm. She left, traveling further to the East.

“And when did this happen?” I asked the traders. They said it was in the Fall of the year, as they had heard the story.

I dissembled my sudden illness, making as if it had been too much wine; I went out into the cold of an alley and spewed until I thought my guts would come flying out of my nose. I have been ill, with drink or with the heaving sickness, but I had never been so desperately, cruelly, dismally sick. Nor have I ever been again.

In my simple arrogance, I had thought I had simply been removing a curse. It had never crossed my mind that it would leave Thass unprotected.

Carezma? Ah. Yes. The wicked do sometimes prosper, don’t they. She had cursed Thaseraine, and broken her from Edroc.  She had lured Thaseraine into a far land, whether on purpose or by chance I shall never know. She had brought ruin in her wake to Ystri, and then left, safely untouched by the ill she had wrought.

But… I was unsatisfied with that. After I had recovered from my illness, I spent five days straight, or perhaps six, working on a painting of Carezma that I had done earlier. I had learned to paint to reverse a curse, but I had learned that I could do more than that. There was justice in every brushstroke, as I repainted her.

The painting of Carezma is still here. You’ll see it in the morning, I think. Yes, I made her look like that.

It’s nowhere near as great a work as Autumnal Woman, as I think you will realize. But—and not all artists would agree with this—the great emotions are the fuel of which great Art is the flame. Guilt is one of the greatest, don’t you think?

I think I shall take my rowboat out on the Lake, out under the stars. I apologize for leaving you to your own devices.

Oh—please be so good as to stay out of the North Wing of the house while I’m not here to escort you. The art there is most unsafe to touch; at night, by lamplight, unsafe even to view.
