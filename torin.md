To the north, the gray cold sea. Torin’s seaward faces are forbidding: tall walls of cliff and mountain, with little landing for ships, and little shelter from the ferocity of the storms.
To the east and southeast, the great river in its canyon, seldom broken by fords. The cliffs rise high, for it’s mountain peaks and ranges, both ways.
To the south, the many-armed, mystical lake.
To the West. another great river, slow and winding, with the secretive Lakelands and their marshes beyond.
Torin
Torin is a strange land, different from its neighbors. Its pastures and gardens are raised high and cold, and poor for tilling and herds. It would be a desolate land, probably, except for the caverns in which grow the <stones>. 
The ways of Torin are scant paths and trails rather than roads.
